# Environmental-Monitoring-System
This project is a real-time environmental monitoring system built using an ESP32 microcontroller, which reads temperature, humidity data using a DHT11 sensor. It displays live readings on an RGB LCD display, uses LEDs and a buzzer for alerts, and uploads data to the ThingSpeak cloud for Visualization and Analysis.
